CardGame project thoughs:

This project was part of my school. I couldnt find job for summer so I desided make own project with friend. My friend part of this project was game designer and mine was game designer/coder. I have code the whole project bottom to top. It includes Server side and client side. Before this project I didn't have any idea how multiplayer games work. Doing this project opened my eyes how its done and I have pretty good understanding how client side and server side works. Project works well and you are able to play full match agains other player. There is always thing to make better but this project was desined to last 350h but it get to little bit under 500 hours.

What I learned:
	- How server communicates with client by sending packets
	- What packets I should send and what not. I shouldn't send other clients information what they dont need.. because they might use it on agains other players.. by hacking.
	- Security issues
	- Hard work pays off.. Coding gets better everyday
	- When you can deside your own work flow it easily can go overboard.. This was very massive project for one coder. And I saw it when I worked.. Too many hourses many days straight didn't make me feel well and it showed by day to week breaks.
	- To make rotine and plan helps a lot when you have a lot of to do.
